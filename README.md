# Automation
Automate my recurring tasks


## Motivation

For too long, I have been repeating the same set of commands to perform my everyday stuffs. I have poor memory, so I tend to look up the same solution from time to time on the [Stack Exchange sites](https://stackexchange.com/) or use the reverse-i-search in my Bash terminal.
It's time to finally automate these recurring stuffs!
